The Ugly Duckling
One summer in a beautiful country barnyard, a duck sat upon a nest of eggs waiting and waiting for them to hatch.
The duck was very lonely because all of the other ducks who lived on the farm were swimming and playing in the pond.
They did not want to sit in the hot sun with the duck and wait for the eggs to hatch.
Finally, the eggs began to crack and the little baby ducklings poked their heads through the broken eggshells and started to cry out, "Quack, quack!"
Upon hearing this sound, a very old duck came along to check on the Mother Duck. "Hello, Mother Duck. I see your eggs have hatched."
"Yes they have, and I am so happy. Aren't these the most beautiful ducklings you have ever seen? But this last egg still has not hatched."
The Mother Duck moved aside so that the Old Duck could see the remaining egg, which was very large.
"That looks like a turkey egg. Maybe you've been tricked," said the Old Duck. "You should teach your other children to swim before they are too old. If you wait, they will be too afraid to jump in the pond. Leave this other egg for awhile and come back after a swim to see if it has hatched."
"No, I cannot leave my baby duckling until he or she hatches. I am sure it will not be too long before it does, and the others will learn to swim without a problem," insisted the Mother Duck.
The Old Duck decided to sit with the Mother Duck while she waited for the big egg to hatch.
The next day, the big egg shook and cracked and the last baby duckling waddled out of the broken eggshell.
The Old Duck and the Mother Duck looked at the last baby duckling with great surprise.
She looked nothing like the other ducks.
In fact, she did not really look like much of a duck at all.
She was big, gray, ugly and strange looking.
"Well, she certainly is an unusual looking duckling," said the Old Duck.
"Hmm, said the Mother Duck. "She must be so big and odd because she was in the egg for so long. She is rather pretty if you look at her a certain way. In time, I am sure she will grow into a proper looking duck."
The Mother Duck led her children to the pond and one-by-one, they all jumped in.
The ugly, gray duckling swam very well.
Actually, she swam even better than the other ducklings.
The Mother Duck was happily surprised.
She was very worried that she might have been a poor swimmer because she was so big.
But after their swim, the Mother Duck and her family went into the barnyard.
All of the animals stopped in their tracks as soon as they noticed the ugly duckling.
They began to come up to her and tease her.
One young duck even bit her.
A hen came and grabbed some of the ugly duckling's feathers in her beak and pulled until the Ugly Duckling began to cry.
And then, all of the animals began to sing and laugh, "Look, look, here, here, ho, ho, boo-hoo, see the Ugly Duckling cry. Look, look, here, here, ho, ho, boo-hoo, see the Ugly Duckling cry. Her neck is too long. Her feathers are dry."
"Leave her alone," said the Mother Duck. "She's not hurting anyone."
"Yes, but she is just so big and ugly that she should be forced to leave the farm so that we don't have to look at her," said the Duck who had bitten the ugly duckling.
"Don't say that!" shouted the Mother Duck. "She may not be pretty but she is very kind and sweet and a very good swimmer. As a matter of fact, she swims even better than her brothers and sisters, and I think that in time, she will become smaller and prettier. Now just leave her alone."
Even though her mother tried to make them all see that she was a good duck, the next few days were terrible for the ugly duckling.
The other animals of the farmyard did not obey the Mother Duck's order to leave the Ugly Duckling alone.
Instead, they became even meaner to the Ugly Duckling and soon her brothers and sisters began to tease her too.
And eventually, her mother became too tired to defend her anymore.
And so, one night, the Ugly Duckling snuck away from the farm into the great, wide world.
She traveled a long, long way until she finally found a huge field and fell asleep.
In the morning, the Ugly Duckling awoke to find herself surrounded by several wild ducks.
One of the ducks began to tease her for being so ugly.
Another duck told her, "It's okay that you are so ugly as long as you don't marry into our family."
The Ugly Duckling soon moved on.
After traveling for a while, the Ugly Duckling found a gaggle of geese and stopped to look at them.
She hoped that she might be able to join them.
As she approached, she heard a loud, "BANG! BANG!"
Two geese fell dead to the ground.
In the distance, the Ugly Duckling saw some men with hunting rifles.
She got very scared and decided to run away from the geese.
She ran and ran until she was very far away and very tired.
She could hardly breathe from running so fast.
She stopped and turned around.
She could no longer see the geese but she realized that she was standing next to a beautiful lake.
She saw the most beautiful birds that she had ever seen gliding on the surface of the lake's clear, blue water.
They had long necks and soft white feathers.
"Oh, those pretty birds will never allow me to join them or swim with them. They're so beautiful and I am so ugly," thought the ugly duckling.
Suddenly, the beautiful birds noticed the Ugly Duckling and swam toward the edge of the lake where she was standing.
One of them said, "Hello, young swan. Where did you come from?"
"Me?" said the Ugly Duckling in surprise, "I came from a place that is very far away. I don't know what a swan is but I am a duck. What is a swan?"
The beautiful birds began to laugh. "What is a swan? Why, we are swans and so are you. You are not a duck. Imagine! You as a duck! A swan would make a very funny-looking duck. But you are the most beautiful young swan here. Come live with us and we will raise you."
"I'm a swan! I AM beautiful!" rejoiced the swan who was no longer an ugly duckling.
"Finally, I am accepted," the swan thought to herself joyfully.


Goldilocks And The Three Bears
Once upon a time there were three bears -- Baby bear, Mommy Bear, and Daddy bear
All three bears were very tidy, polite, and good natured. They lived in a cozy cottage in the forest and were very happy.
Each bear had his or her own porridge pot.
There was a tiny pot for Baby Bear, a mid-sized pot for Mommy Bear, and a great, huge pot for Daddy Bear.
And each bear had his or her own comfy chair to sit upon.
There was a tiny chair for Baby Bear, a middle-sized chair for Mommy Bear, and a great, ginormous chair for Daddy Bear.
And each bear had a bed to sleep in that was just perfect for them.
There was a small bed for Baby Bear, a middle-sized bed for Mommy Bear, and a great, humongous bed for Daddy Bear.
One morning, Daddy Bear made breakfast. But when he poured the porridge into the 1:10
three porridge pots, he realized the porridge was much too hot to eat.
“I’ve got an idea,” he said, “why don’t we take a walk in the forest while we wait for our food to cool?”
Mommy Bear and Baby Bear liked this idea very much and so the family went outside for a short walk.
Meanwhile, a little girl was also taking a walk in the forest. Her name was Goldilocks because she had thick blonde curls.
Goldilocks was a normally a good girl but she had one problem – she was very, very curious. If she saw something that interested her, she had to go find out what it was.
Suddenly, Goldilock’s came upon the Bears’ cottage.
First Goldilocks peered in at the window.
Then she peeped in through the keyhole.
It didn’t look like anyone was at home. She lifted the latch and walked in.
Inside the kitchen Goldilocks was delighted to find three bowls of porridge.
“Oh!” She exclaimed, “I wonder what that tastes like?”
Goldilocks had walked for a long time and her tummy was rumbling. “ I guess it’s okay if I just try some of it…” she decided.
First, she tasted Daddy Bear’s porridge, but it was too hot.
“Oww!” she cried out.
Next, she tasted Mommy Bear’s porridge, but that was too cold.
“Blech!” she yelped.
Finally, she tasted Baby Bear’s porridge. It was neihter too hot nor too cold.
It tasted ... just ….right.
“Yummy!” she said.
Forgetting her original plan, Goldilocks quickly gobbled down Baby Bear’s porridge.
After eating, Goldilocks felt very full.
Looking around, Goldilocks noticed the bears’ three comfy chairs. “Oh, I could rest my feet for a little while,” Goldilocks said to herself.
She went in and sat down in Daddy Bear’s chair, but the cushion was too hard.
Next she sat down in Mommy Bear’s chair, but it was too soft.
Finally she sat down in Baby Bear’s little chair, which was neither too hard nor too soft.
It felt … just … right.
“Ahh!” she said. The cushion felt nice but Goldilocks was much bigger than the chair and soon it began to cave in under her weight. There was a loud crack as the chair broke in half and Goldilocks fell on the floor.
“Oops,” she exclaimed and then she yawned, “ All that walking and eating made me really sleepy.”
Goldilocks got up and climbed the stairs to the bedroom. There, she saw three warm beds.
“Oh, I really am very tired,” Goldilocks said. “I’ll take a little nap and then go back on my walk.”
First Goldilocks lay down in Daddy Bear’s bed, but it was too hard.
Next she lay down in the Mommy Bear’s bed, but it was too soft.
Finally Goldilocks lay down on the Baby Bear’s bed.
The bed was neither too hard nor too soft.
It felt … just … right for her.
“Mmm,” she said, yawning.
Goldilocks covered herself with the blankets, rolled over and fell deep asleep, snoring away.
By this time the three bears had returned from their walk hungry and ready to eat their breakfast.
“Hey, somebody’s been eating my porridge,” exclaimed Daddy Bear. “They left the spoon standing in the bowl!”
“And somebody’s been eating my porridge,” said Mommy Bear. “There’s a whole chunk missing from it!”
Then Baby Bear looked at his empty porridge pot with the spoon lying in the bottom.
“And somebody’s been eating my porridge,” he exclaimed sadly. “And they’ve eaten it all up, too!”
The three bears went to search the living room.
“Somebody’s been sitting in my chair,” growled Daddy Bear. “The seat’s been moved!”
“And somebody’s been sitting in my chair,” exclaimed Mommy Bear, “There’s a gold hair on it!”
Hiccup
Baby Bear stood sadly in front of his chair.
“Somebody’s been in my chair,” he cried, “And they broke it in two!”
Feeling very worried, the three good bears now went upstairs to search the bedroom.
“Somebody’s been lying in my bed,” said Daddy Bear. “The pillow’s out of place!”!
“And somebody’s been lying in my bed,” added Mommy Bear. “The sheets are all ruffled.”
But when Baby Bear looked at his bed, the pillow and sheets were both in their proper places.
However, resting upon the pillow was the tiny, golden-curled head of Goldilocks.
“Somebody’s been lying in my bed,” shouted Baby Bear. “And here she is!”
Hearing the voice of the bear, Goldilocks woke and sprang up out of bed.
She was shocked to see three angry bears on one side of her bed.
“Are you the one who broke my chair?” Asked Baby bear.
“Yes,” said Goldilocks looking down at her feet, “I guess that was me.”
“And are you the one who ate my porridge?” asked Baby Bear.
“Yes,” said Goldilocks feeling more and more embarrased, “I did that too.”
Baby Bear began to cry and Goldilocks realized her bad behavior.
“Don’t cry!”, she exclaimed. “I’m sorry! I didn’t mean to barge into your house or eat your food or break your chair! I’ll help you fix it.”
“But why did you do it?” Asked Daddy Bear.
“I was curious,” said Goldilocks.
“Curious?” Said Daddy Bear, “Hmm.”
“It won’t ever happen again!” said Goldilocks.
The Three Bears looked at Goldilocks and thought for a minute.
“Oh I don’t know about that,” said Daddy Bear, “ we love having guests and we’d like it if you came back again. Just ask us beforehand.”
“Really?” said Goldilocks, “Are you sure?”
“It’s okay” said Mommy Bear. “You did a bad thing but you didn’t mean any harm. And now you know -- Always ask permission before you share other people’s things.”
“And don’t forget,” said Baby Bear, “You promised to help me fix my chair.”
“Of course!” Said Goldilocks and the two went downstairs to find some glue. From then on the Bears and Goldilocks were great friends.
They even got Goldilocks her own pot for porridge, a chair, and a bed so she would always be part of the family.


Jack And The Beanstalk
Once upon a time, there was a poor widow who lived in a little cottage with her son Jack.
One day the widow sent her son to the market to sell their cow so that they could have some money.
But on the way, Jack met a man who offered him some beans in exchange for the cow.
Jack took the beans but when he got home, his mother was very upset that he had brought them beans instead of money.
Jack said that they could plant the beans to grow food but his mother did not feel any better.
Jack planted the beans anyway.
The next morning, a great, huge beanstalk appeared where Jack had planted the beans.
Jack wanted to climb the beanstalk to see where it led, and so he said goodbye to his mother and up the stalk he went.
He climbed and climbed until he was in the clouds.
Finally, he reached an enormous, green valley in the sky.
When he climbed onto the grassy surface, he immediately saw a huge castle.
Then he noticed an old woman nearby.
Jack approached the woman and said, "Hello Madam, is that your home?"
"No," said the old lady. "But I can tell you the story of that castle... Once upon a time there was a noble knight, who lived in that castle, which is on the border of Fairyland. He and his wife and children were liked by all of their neighbors.
One day an evil giant attacked the castle and took away the man and his children but the wife and the youngest child were not at home. They were visiting an old nurse. When news of the giant's attack reached the wife, she knew she had to stay with the nurse to protect her son and herself. Eventually, the old nurse passed away and the woman and her son continued to live at the nurse's house but they became very poor.
The giant and his wife moved into the castle and still live there today.
Now, I will tell you who the woman and her son are... The son is you and the woman is your mother, and that castle belonged to your father.
You must take it back from the Giant for you and your mother to own."
Jack was shocked. "My poor mother," he said.
"Do you have the courage to fight the Giant?" asked the old woman.
"I must have the courage to do what is right," said Jack.
"Good, now to defeat the Giant you must enter the castle, and if possible take the hen that lays the golden eggs and the harp that speaks. Remember you are not stealing because everything in the castle belongs to you and your family."
Then suddenly the woman vanished and Jack realized that she was a fairy.
Jack ran to the castle and rang the bell.
The Giant's wife opened the door.
She looked down and saw Jack and grabbed him and dragged him into the castle.
Then she told Jack that he was to be her servant and to help her with her chores, but that when her husband was home, he would have to hide in her closet so that he would not eat him.
Just then, Jack heard a loud thump on the stairs and a booming voice called out,
"Fe, fa, fi-fo-fum,
I smell the breath of an Englishman.
Let him be alive or let him be dead,
I'll grind his bones to make my bread."
"Wife," cried the Giant, "there is a man in the castle. Let me have him for breakfast."
But the Giant's Wife shouted back that he was wrong and that no one was in the castle.
Later, the giant left for a walk and Jack helped the Giant's Wife with all her many chores around the huge castle.
That evening, the Giant returned for supper and Jack hid back in the closet.
He watched as the giant and his wife sat at the dining table, and he saw that at the giant's feet was a hen.
A few minutes later, the hen laid a golden egg and Jack realized that this was the hen that the fairy had told him to take.
So, when the giants had gone to sleep, he snuck into the dining room and snatched the hen.
Then just as he was leaving the room, he noticed a large bag of gold coins sitting on the serving table and he remembered that the fairy had said that everything in the castle belonged to him and his mother, and so he took the bag as well.
He rushed out of the castle and down the beanstalk to his mother's house.
Jack woke his mother and showed her the hen and the bag of gold and told her about the giants.
She was shocked and happy for the gold and the hen, which would save them from being poor.
But, she wanted Jack to stay and not return to the castle, but Jack convinced her that he must go back and fight for their family's castle.
Jack snuck back into the castle and back into the closet before the giants awoke.
The next day the giant and the giantess had their breakfast and afterwards the giant lay down and said, "Wife, bring me my harp, and I will listen to some music while you take your walk."
The giantess returned with a beautiful harp, which sparkled with diamonds and rubies and had gold strings.
The giant looked at the harp and said, "Play!"
And the harp played a very beautiful lullaby, for this was the giant's naptime.
Once the giant was asleep and the Giant's wife went out to take her walk, Jack crept out of the closet and quickly and silently grabbed the harp and started to dash away from the sleeping giant.
But the harp began to shout, "Help! Master! I am being stolen!"
Jack told the harp that he was the son of the knight who owned the castle and the harp stopped shouting.
But it was too late.
The giant was already awake and chasing them.
Jack ran out of the castle and all the way down the beanstalk to his mother's home.
He grabbed an ax from their woodshed and cut down the beanstalk.
And, the giant, who was following them down the stalk, fell to the ground and broke his neck.
Then the old fairy appeared and took Jack and his mother back to the castle by magic.
Jack rang the doorbell and the Giant's wife who was worried about her missing husband came running and fell and broke her neck and died.
And so, Jack and his mother moved back into their castle and live happily ever after.


Little Red Riding Hood
There was a young girl whom everyone called "Little Red Riding Hood," because she never went anywhere without wearing a cap made of lovely red velvet that her grandmother had given to her.
One day her grandmother fell ill and Little Red Riding Hood's mother said to her, "I have baked a cake for your grandmother, and bought her a bottle of wine. Here, take them to grandma; they will help her get well."
Of course, the young girl was happy to help.
Grandma lived in a cottage in the woods, so before Little Red Riding Hood set off, her mother told her,
"Please be careful. Stick to the path. Don't run, because if you fall over, the cake will get dirty and the bottle will break, and then grandma will get nothing."
"I will be VERY careful," Little Red Riding Hood promised her mother.
Little Red Riding Hood put on her coat and gloves and her red velvet cap.
She tucked the cake and the bottle of wine into her backpack.
Then she walked off down the lane to the woods, singing a song she had learned at school.
After she was just a few yards into the woods, a wolf came up to her.
"Well, hello there, young girl," the wolf said. "Where are you off to?"
Because the wolf was so very polite, Little Red Riding Hood said hello back and told him she was on her way to her grandmother's home.
"My grandma lives in these woods."
"I'll bet she lives in that big cottage by the pond," the wolf said. "That's right," Little Red Riding Hood said.
"And I'll bet you are carrying bread and milk in that backpack of yours," the wolf said.
He had a smile on his face.
"Actually, it's cake and a bottle of wine. From my mother."
"For grandma?" the wolf asked.
"She hasn't been feeling well. These will make her better," Little Red Riding Hood said.
The wolf stretched his smile even wider.
He seemed like such a nice, friendly wolf, but behind that smile he was thinking: "What a tender young creature this girl is. What a tasty meal she would make. It's been so long since I've eaten anything half as delicious as her!"
Still, the wolf knew he would have to be very sneaky to trap Little Red Riding Hood.
So, when the young girl started walking again, he kept pace with her.
As they walked side by side, he pointed out the flowers to her, and the trees.
"Look," he said. "Look how beautiful Nature can be. Listen to the birds sing. See what wonderful things you are missing when you rush around all the time, always in such a hurry."
Little Red Riding Hood raised her eyes.
She watched sunbeams dance between the clouds.
She saw birds scratch their heads with their wings, and flowers of every color you can imagine.
"Perhaps I should take a few minutes to pick a bunch of flowers for grandma," she said. "That would certainly lift her spirits."
"There's plenty of time," the wolf agreed.
Before she knew it, Little Red Riding Hood had stepped off the path to search for flowers.
Whenever she looked up, she saw prettier and prettier ones, deeper and deeper in the woods.
Soon she was far away from the path, and a little bit lost.
Meanwhile, the wolf ran straight to grandmother's house and knocked on the door.
"Who's there?" Grandma asked in a weak voice.
"Little Red Riding Hood," the wolf replied. "I'm bringing goodies from mother. Open the door."
"The door's not locked," Grandma said. "Let yourself in. I'm too sick to get up."
The wolf turned the doorknob, ran straight to grandmother's bedside and without saying a word...
Swallowed her up in one mouthful!
Then he put on her pajamas, closed the drapes and climbed into grandma's bed.
It was beginning to get dark by the time Little Red Riding Hood decided she had collected enough flowers for Grandma.
It was getting REALLY dark by the time she found her way back to the path through the woods.
When she finally reached grandma's cottage, it was night-time.
She was surprised to find the door to the cottage open. "Grandma," she called. "Is everything all right?"
There was no answer.
Little Red Riding Hood went in slowly, carefully.
She turned on a light and walked up to the bed in slow, careful steps. Grandma lay very still, the blankets pulled tight up to her chin.
"My," the girl said. "What big ears you have!"
"The better to hear you with, my child."
"Grandma, what big eyes you have!"
"The better to see you with, my dear."
"Goodness me," said Little Red Riding Hood. "Just look at those large hands!"
"The better to hug you with."
"Oh, that mouth, grandma. What a huge, gigantic, ENORMOUS mouth!"
"The better to eat you with!"
And in one leap, the wolf was out of the bed and had gobbled Little Red Riding Hood up.
Well, now, of course, the wolf's stomach was completely full.
He flopped back onto the bed and was soon fast asleep.
You may not know this, but when wolves sleep they snore very loudly.
A little while later, a hunter was passing by grandma's cottage on his way home after a day's hunting.
He heard loud snoring and thought, "Oh My! Maybe the old lady is having a nightmare. I better try to wake her."
As soon as he entered the cottage, he realized that the old lady wasn't an old lady at all, but a wolf.
And not just any wolf!
The same wolf, in fact, he had been hunting for years.
The hunter was about to shoot the wolf when he realized that maybe the wolf had eaten the old lady whose cottage this was.
In case the old lady could still be saved, the hunter put down his rifle and picked up a pair of scissors.
He snipped open the wolf's tummy. One snip, two snips and then â€” the hunter spotted a shiny red cap!
Another snip, then another snip more. Suddenly a little girl sprang out of the wolf's stomach, in one whole piece.
She cried, "Thank heavens you came to our rescue. It was so dark and frightening inside that wolf."
A moment later, Little Red Riding Hood's grandmother pushed her head through the gap in the wolf's tummy.
She was alive, too.
She was so delighted to have been freed from inside the wolf she did not feel sick any more.
She felt quite hungry as a matter of fact, and soon she, the hunter and Little Red Riding Hood were busy eating cake.
They filled up the wolf's tummy with rocks and sewed it closed.
After that, the wolf could never catch children or old ladies by surprise anymore, and Little Red Riding Hood did not stray from the path through the woods ever again.
